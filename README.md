A Little Scheme
===================

This language is a very little language, with very few features.

Use it in contexts where simplicity is desired above convenience.

Installation
------------
Check out the package, then run
```
raco pkg install
```
in the `dan-scheme` directory.


Use
---
Begin a Racket file with `#lang dan-scheme`. That's it!
